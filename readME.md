# Cover-Letter-Maker

Cover Letter Maker is an application that generates a cover letter according to the user's input. It means to reduce the amount of time that people spend on constructing a cover letter.

Each year I spend a lot of time writing a cover letter for coop intern. This fact inspires me to come up with a piece of software that can reduce this workload.

## How does Cover Letter Maker works?

1. Ask users to upload a Docx file containing a list of body paragraphs
2. Ask users to a few info needed for their cover letter
3. Extract the info entered by users
4. Generate some necessary info
5. Format, beautify and substitute the info into a prepared model
6. Assemble all sections and return a well-done cover letter to users

## Key skills

- Python
- I/O
- Regex library
- python-docx library

## Upcoming features

This 1st version is a pure python scripts that is only avaliable for me. However, I am currently working for the 2nd version:

1. Turn this app into a web app by using Flask flamework
2. Add HTML and CSS for UI
3. Deploy it on Heroku
